# susbot for pixelplace.io, made by deviousname
It is probably best if you use Python 3.7.9 or the imposter will jump out of a vent and get you:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/

-susbot works by opening an automated browser window and logging in through Reddit to bypass the CAPTCHA system of pixelplace.io-

If you do not have a Reddit account, you will need one in order to use susbot, otherwise you will need to rewrite the code to suit your non-Reddit needs.

If you use Chrome, you need to find the matching chromedriver.exe

chromedriver can be found here:  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Firefox users should work too, and they will need to get their corresponding Firefox (geckodriver) driver.

Firefox drivers can be found here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Also read this comment to set the driver in the code: https://github.com/deviousname/susbot/blob/be712780379d2fb0215220c59d3cbf306317b7c5/susbot_main.py#L52

Once you have the driver, simply copy and paste it into the same folder as susbot.
Set your Reddit name and password in crewmate.py and then run susbotmain.py
Note: while it is logging in don't click around or do anything, just wait for pixeplace.io to fully load in, and then you can use it.
Additional Note: if you switch maps in the main tab, you need to reload the colors by holding down "j" for a moment.
Premium colors have not been included into the public version of susbot, you can add them yourself by following the format of the other colors.
Final note: I'm lazy. Have a wonderful day.
