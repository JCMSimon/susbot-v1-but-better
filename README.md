# susbot for pixelplace.io, made by deviousname, probably best if you use Python 3.7.9 or the imposter jump out of a vent and get you

susbot works by opening an automated browser window and loging in through reddit to bypass the CAPTCHA system of pixelplace.io
if you do not have a reddit account, you will need one in order to use susbot, otherwise you will need to rewrite the code to suit your non-reddit needs

if you use Chrome, you need to find the matching chromedriver.exe
chromedriver can be found here:  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Firefox users should work too, and they will need to get their corresponding firefoxdriver (i think they call it geckodriver)
Firefox drivers can be found here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

once you have the driver, simply copy and paste it into the same folder as susbot
set your Reddit name and password in crewmate.py and then run susbotmain.py

Note: while its logging in don't click around or do anything, just wait for pixeplace.io to fully load in, then it will be usable
Additional Note: if you switch maps in the main tab, you need to reload the colors by holding down "j" for a moment
Premium colors have not been included into the public version of susbot, you can add them yourself by following the format of the other colors

Final note: I'm lazy. Have a wonderful day.
